        <h1 id="NFL-players-speak-out-against-sports-gambling"><a href="#NFL-players-speak-out-against-sports-gambling" class="headerlink" title="NFL players speak out against sports gambling"></a>NFL players speak out against sports gambling</h1><p>As the NFL season gets underway, many of the league’s top players are speaking out against the legalization of sports gambling.</p>
<p>“I think it’s a terrible idea,” said Patriots quarterback Tom Brady. “There’s enough opportunity for people to make money lawfully without introducing more opportunity for cheating and manipulating the game.”</p>
<p>Brady isn’t alone in his opposition to sports gambling. Other NFL stars, including Aaron Rodgers and Von Miller, have voiced similar concerns. They worry that legalizing sports betting will lead to increased corruption and cheating in the sport.</p>
<p>Some lawmakers argue that legalizing sports betting would help generate much-needed revenue for state governments. But the NFL players don’t seem convinced.</p>
<p>“I don’t think it’s a good idea for our economy or for the integrity of our game,” said Rodgers.</p>
<h1 id="NJ-lawmakers-propose-bill-to-stop-sports-gambling"><a href="#NJ-lawmakers-propose-bill-to-stop-sports-gambling" class="headerlink" title="NJ lawmakers propose bill to stop sports gambling"></a>NJ lawmakers propose bill to stop sports gambling</h1><p>As the US Supreme Court readies to rule on a case that could legalize sports gambling nationwide, several states are moving to get ahead of the curve and pass legislation to permit it within their borders. New Jersey is one of those states, and its lawmakers are now proposing a bill that would specifically outlaw sports betting.</p>
<p>The proposed bill, which was introduced last week, would amend the state’s existing gambling laws to prohibit “the placing of a bet or wager on any professional or collegiate sport, athletic event, or contest.” Penalties for violating the law would range from a misdemeanor to a felony, depending on the amount wagered.</p>
<p>New Jersey has been fighting for years to allow sports betting in the state, arguing that it would bring in much-needed revenue. But opponents, including major league sports teams and the NCAA, have argued that gambling poses a threat to the integrity of sporting events. The US Supreme Court is expected to rule on the case this month.</p>
<p>If the court rules in favor of New Jersey, other states are likely to follow its lead and pass their own legalization bills. This proposed bill in New Jersey could be seen as an attempt by lawmakers there to get ahead of things and make sure that sports betting is not allowed in the state regardless of what happens at the federal level.</p>
<h1 id="NBA-commissioner-speaks-out-against-legalized-sports-gambling"><a href="#NBA-commissioner-speaks-out-against-legalized-sports-gambling" class="headerlink" title="NBA commissioner speaks out against legalized sports gambling"></a>NBA commissioner speaks out against legalized sports gambling</h1><p>In a strongly worded statement issued on Thursday, NBA commissioner Adam Silver spoke out against the legalization of sports gambling, calling it “a threat to the integrity of our sport.”</p>
<p>“The integrity of our game is of paramount importance to the NBA,” said Silver. “As has been demonstrated by the revelations recently aired in the media, it is essential that we take all necessary steps to protect the fairness and integrity of our games.”</p>
<p>Silver’s comments come in the wake of reports that several high-profile NBA players have been linked to illegal gambling activities. The league has already launched an investigation into the matter.</p>
<p>“If sports gambling is legalized, it will be even more difficult to monitor nefarious activity and ensure a level playing field for all teams and players,” said Silver. “This is not something I or the NBA can support.”</p>
<h1 id="Study-shows-majority-of-Americans-oppose-legalizing-sports-gambling"><a href="#Study-shows-majority-of-Americans-oppose-legalizing-sports-gambling" class="headerlink" title="Study shows majority of Americans oppose legalizing sports gambling"></a>Study shows majority of Americans oppose legalizing sports gambling</h1><p>The study, conducted by the University of Delaware, showed that 55% of Americans oppose legalizing sports gambling, while only 36% support it. Opposition to legalizing sports gambling was highest among Republicans (72%), followed by independents (60%) and Democrats (49%). Support for legalizing sports gambling was highest among independents (48%), followed by Republicans (39%) and Democrats (36%).</p>
<p>“Our findings suggest that there is some resistance to the legalization of sports gambling, even among those who gamble on sports already,” said Anthony P. Calvillo, assistant professor of political science at the University of Delaware and lead author of the study. “This suggests that any effort to legalize sports gambling will likely be met with significant opposition in Congress.”</p>
<p>The study also found that there is little difference in opposition to legalized sports gambling among those who gamble on sports either online or through a bookie. Only 42% of those who gamble on sports online support legalization, while 47% of those who use a bookie support it.</p>
<p>Legalized sports gambling has been a controversial topic in recent years, as more states have considered it. The Supreme Court struck down a federal law in May 2018 that prohibited most states from legalizing sports betting, opening the door for states to decide whether to permit it. So far, 10 states have legalized some form of sports betting since the ruling.</p>
<p>Opposition to legalized sports gambling has come from various sources, including professional athletes and leagues, who argue that it could lead to cheating and corruption. Others argue that legalization would hurt bettors who lose money, as well as casinos and other businesses that profit from legal gambling.</p>
<h1 id="Legalized-sports-gambling-could-lead-to-match-fixing-and-other-criminal-activity"><a href="#Legalized-sports-gambling-could-lead-to-match-fixing-and-other-criminal-activity" class="headerlink" title="Legalized sports gambling could lead to match-fixing and other criminal activity"></a>Legalized sports gambling could lead to match-fixing and other criminal activity</h1><p>The Supreme Court has recently ruled that the federal ban on sports gambling is unconstitutional, paving the way for states to legalize and regulate the activity. This could have a number of negative consequences, including increased match-fixing and other criminal activity.</p>
<p>As more and more people engage in sports gambling, there is a greater risk of corruption within the sport. Match-fixing is a major problem in soccer and other sports, and it is likely to become worse if sports gambling is legalized. Gamblers can make large profits by fixing games, and they may be willing to pay players or coaches to ensure a desired outcome.</p>
<p>Legalized sports gambling could also lead to an increase in other criminal activity. Gambling addiction is a serious problem, and it can lead people to commit crimes in order to finance their habit. Additionally, organized crime syndicates are likely to become involved in the sports gambling industry, as they have done in other countries that have legalized gambling. This could lead to an increase in money laundering and other criminal activities.</p>
<p>Overall, it seems that legalized sports gambling would be a bad decision for society. It would not only lead to increased corruption and crime, but it would also victimize innocent people who become addicted to gambling. States should think carefully before legalizing this dangerous activity.</p>
