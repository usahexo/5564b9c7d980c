#  Sri Lanka Hosts First Purse Bingo Fundraiser!

As a fundraiser for the new Sri Lanka Women's Purse Museum, the Sri Lanka Purse Bingo Association organized and hosted the first purse bingo game in Colombo on March 3, 2019. The game was held at the Mount Lavinia Hotel and featured many luxury purses as prizes.

All proceeds from the game will go to benefit the museum, which is set to open its doors to the public in 2020. The museum will be dedicated to showcasing and celebrating historic and contemporary purses from Sri Lanka and around the world.

According to Rahila Mohamed, President of the Sri Lanka Purse Bingo Association, "the purse bingo game is a great way to raise money for the museum, but it's also a lot of fun! We're excited to host our first game and see everyone come out to play."

The event was very well attended, with over 100 players purchasing tickets. In addition to the many luxury purses that were up for grabs, there were also several smaller prizes donated by local businesses.

After an evening of exciting bingo play, the winners were announced. In first place was Dilani de Silva with a stunning brown Coach purse worth over $600. Second place went to Nishanthi Fernando with a Michael Kors purse valued at $450, while third prize went to Keerthi Prasanna with a pink Kate Spade purse worth $325.

The organizers would like to thank everyone who came out to support this important fundraiser and look forward to hosting more games in the future!

#  Come Out And Play In Support Of Sri Lanka!

In the wake of the Easter Sunday bombing in Sri Lanka that left over 250 people dead and 500 injured, cricketing nations around the world have come out in support of Sri Lanka. The bombings, which took place at three churches and three hotels, were the deadliest terrorist attack in the country’s history.

After suspending their own tour to Sri Lanka, the Indian cricket team announced that they will be playing a charity match in support of those affected by the bombings. The match will be held at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium in Delhi on 17th May and all proceeds from tickets will be donated to help rebuild the churches and hotels that were bombed.

The Australian cricket team also announced that they will be holding a charity match to raise funds for victims of the bombings. The match will take place at Sydney Cricket Ground on 25th May and all money raised will go towards helping those affected by the atrocity.

Other countries have also announced plans to help Sri Lanka in their time of need. The England cricket team has said that they will be making a donation to help rebuild churches in Sri Lanka, while teams from Bangladesh, Pakistan and South Africa have all offered to send aid to the country.

The attacks on Easter Sunday have shocked the cricketing world, but it is heartening to see so many countries coming together to support Sri Lanka during this difficult time. We would like to thank all of the teams who have announced plans to raise money for victims of the bombings, and we hope that their efforts can bring some comfort to those affected by this tragedy.
