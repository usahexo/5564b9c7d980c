The Chicago White Sox are a professional baseball team based in Chicago, Illinois. They are a member of the American League Central division in Major League Baseball.

The White Sox play their home games at Guaranteed Rate Field, which opened in 1991 as Comiskey Park II and was renamed U.S. Cellular Field in 2003. The current name was adopted before the 2016 season.

The White Sox were founded as the Sioux City Cornhuskers in 1894 and moved to St. Paul, Minnesota, in 1901 where they were renamed the St. Paul Saints. The team moved to Chicago for the 1910 season and changed their name to the Chicago White Sox.

The White Sox have won three World Series titles (1906, 1917, 2005). All three championships were won by teams consisting entirely of white players, which led to some controversy and negative media attention for the team. The White Sox have also appeared in four other World Series (1919, 1959, 1983, 1990), losing each time.

In 1901, Charles Comiskey moved his St. Louis Browns franchise to Chicago and they were renamed the "Chicago White Stockings". In 1905 they were renamed the "Chicago White Sox". In 1906, they won their first World Series. From 1919 to 1959 they went to 5 World Series but only won 1 title back in 1923 led by Eddie Cicotte's 29-7 record and Harry Hooper's batting average of .343 

This year is different though with their newly revamped line up including José Abreu who hit 33 homers and drove in 108 RBIs last year or Todd Frazier who finished last season batting .225 with 27 homers and 76 RBIs after being traded from Cincinnati Reds; fans are looking forward to some good old baseball games this year at Guaranteed Rate Field!
