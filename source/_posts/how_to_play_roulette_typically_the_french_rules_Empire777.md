# How to Play Roulette: Typically the French Rules at Empire777

Roulette is a classic casino game that involves betting on the outcome of a spinning wheel. It is a game of chance, but it remains popular among players worldwide. There are different versions of roulette, and at Empire777, players can enjoy playing the French version. In this article, we will explain how to play roulette, focusing on the French rules at Empire777.

## The Basics of Roulette

Before we delve into the French rules, it's important to understand the fundamentals of roulette. The game has a wheel with numbered pockets and a ball that is spun on the wheel. There are two main types of bets: inside bets and outside bets.

Inside bets are placed on specific numbers, while outside bets are placed on groups of numbers. When placing inside bets, you have a better chance of winning, but the payout is lower. On the other hand, outside bets offer a higher payout, but the odds of winning are lower.

## French Roulette Rules at Empire777

French roulette at Empire777 is similar to other versions of roulette, but there are a few variations. The game uses a European wheel, which has 37 pockets, including one zero pocket. The objective is to guess where the ball will land on the wheel.

The French rules at Empire777 offer players a better chance of winning since they come with two unique features:

### La Partage Rule

The La Partage rule applies when you place an even-money bet, such as red or black, odd or even, or high or low. The rule states that if the ball lands on the zero pocket, you will get half of your bet back. This rule reduces the house edge and increases your chances of winning.

### En Prison Rule

The En Prison rule also applies to even-money bets. Suppose you placed an even-money bet, and the ball lands on zero. In that case, your bet is not lost but is "imprisoned" or held for the next spin. If the next spin results in a win, you get your bet back. If not, you lose your bet.
