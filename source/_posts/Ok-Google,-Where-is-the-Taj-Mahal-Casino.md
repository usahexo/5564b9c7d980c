#  Taj Mahal Casino Celebrates 5 Years in Business

The Taj Mahal Casino in Atlantic City is celebrating 5 years in business this month. The casino, which is located on the Boardwalk, opened its doors to the public on April 2, 1990.

At that time, it was the most expensive casino ever built. The casino's owners, Donald Trump and his partners, spent $1 billion to build it.

The Taj Mahal was originally supposed to be called the Trump Taj Mahal. However, Trump ran out of money during construction and had to sell his controlling interest in the casino to another group of investors.

The new owners finished construction of the casino and opened it under its current name.

The Taj Mahal has been a big success. In its first year of operation, it earned more than $1 billion in revenue. It has been one of the top-earning casinos in Atlantic City ever since.

In celebration of its 5th anniversary, the Taj Mahal is offering several special promotions this month. Customers can earn free hotel rooms and meals, as well as free slot play and other prizes.

#  Construction begins on new Taj Mahal Casino Resort!

The new Taj Mahal Casino Resort is under construction and is set to be completed in early 2018. The resort will feature a casino, hotel, restaurants, and retail spaces. It will be the largest casino resort in Atlantic City and will create over 1,000 jobs.

The project is being developed by ACRR LLC, a joint venture between the Trump Organization and Colony Capital. The total cost of the project is estimated at $700 million.

The new Taj Mahal Casino Resort is expected to attract 3 million visitors each year and generate over $400 million in annual revenue. It is also expected to help revitalize Atlantic City's tourism industry.
