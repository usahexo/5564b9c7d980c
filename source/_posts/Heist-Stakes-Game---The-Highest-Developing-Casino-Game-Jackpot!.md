#  Heist Stakes Game - The Most Exciting Casino Game Around!

Heist stakes is one of the most exciting casino games around. The premise is simple - you are a thief, and you have to rob different places in order to get rich. However, there is a catch - the police are hot on your heels, and they will do anything to stop you.

The game is played using a deck of cards. There are four suits, and each suit has a different value. Clubs are worth 1 point, diamonds are worth 2 points, hearts are worth 3 points, and spades are worth 4 points. The player starts with 10 cards, and the aim of the game is to score as many points as possible.

The player can either take a card from the deck or rob a place. If they take a card from the deck, they must add it to their hand. If they rob a place, they must discard one card and take the loot. The player can only rob one place at a time, and they cannot rob the same place twice in a row.

If the player takes a card that matches the suit of the place they are robbing, they get an extra point for each card in that suit. For example, if the player robs a club and takes a six of clubs from the deck, they get 6 points for that robbery (1 point for clubs plus 5 extra points). If the player takes two clubs from the deck, they get 8 points for that robbery (2 points for clubs plus 6 extra points).

If the player takes a king of spades from the deck, they can choose to either exchange it for two other cards or use it as part of a heist. If they use it as part of a heist, it gives them an extra turn.

If the player has more than 10 cards at any point in time, they must discard until they have 10 cards again. The game ends when either all of the places have been robbed or the player runs out of cards. The player with the highest score wins!
