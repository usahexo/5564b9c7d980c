#  Belgium is newest hot spot for blackjack enthusiasts

Belgium is a small country in Western Europe with a population of just over 11 million people. In spite of its relatively small size, Belgium is emerging as a new hot spot for blackjack enthusiasts. This is due in part to the country’s relaxed gambling laws, which allow casinos to offer blackjack games with lower house edges than are typically found in other European countries.

Belgium also boasts a number of world-class casinos, including the Casino de Namur, the Casino de Spa, and the Grand Casino Brussels Viage. These casinos offer blackjack games with rules that are favorable to players. For example, most Belgian casinos allow players to split pairs up to four times, which gives players more opportunities to make big hands.

Belgian casinos also offer a variety of blackjack variants that are not found in most other countries. These variants include Double Exposure Blackjack, Spanish 21 Blackjack, and Pontoon. Double Exposure Blackjack is a variant in which both the dealer’s cards are dealt face up, giving players a better chance of winning against the house. Spanish 21 Blackjack is a variant that uses player-friendly rules such as doubling down on any two cards and splitting pairs up to three times. Pontoon is a British variant that features very liberal rules for doubling down and splitting pairs.

If you are interested in playing blackjack in a relaxed and friendly environment, then Belgium should definitely be on your list of destinations. The country offers some of the best blackjack games in Europe, and its casinos are staffed by friendly and knowledgeable dealers who will make your gaming experience enjoyable and rewarding.

#  Belgium casinos offer flush plus side bet

Belgium casinos have started to offer a side bet on the flop in addition to the normal wager. The side bet, called Flush Plus, pays out if the player has a flush or better. The amount paid out is based on the rank of the flush.

For example, if a player has a flush and the dealer has a six-high straight, the player would win 9 to 1 on their Flush Plus bet. If the player has two pair and the dealer has two pair, the player would lose their Flush Plus bet. Unlike other casino games, there is no house edge on this side bet; it is purely a 50-50 proposition.

Some casinos are offering different payouts for different ranks of flushes. For example, one casino may payout 9 to 1 for any flush, while another casino may payout 10 to 1 for any flush that is higher than three cards of different suits.

The popularity of this side bet is exploding in Belgium casinos. Players are flocking to try their luck at winning big payouts on this simple wager. With no house edge, it’s an easy way to add excitement to your game without risking anything additional.

#  Belgian casinos report increase in blackjack popularity

According to Belgian media outlets, blackjack is becoming an increasingly popular casino game, particularly among the country's millennials. Blackjack is seen as a more sophisticated game than slots, and players can make more complex decisions to improve their chances of winning.

Belgian casinos are now offering a wider range of blackjack variants, including games with side bets and progressive jackpots. These games are designed to appeal to risk-takers who want to boost their chances of winning big.

Blackjack has been around for centuries, and it remains one of the most popular casino games in the world. Thanks to its simplicity and relatively low house edge, blackjack is a favourite among both casual and experienced players.

Online casinos have also helped to popularise blackjack, with many sites offering multiple variants of the game. This has made it easier for players to find a version that suits their style and playing budget.

If you're looking for a fun and exciting casino game, blackjack is worth giving a try. With so many variants available, there's something for everyone. So roll the dice and see if you can beat the dealer!

#  Flush plus gaining ground in European blackjack circles

Flush has always been a popular game, but its popularity is gaining ground in European blackjack circles. It is played with six standard decks of 52 cards each. Aces are worth 1 or 11 points, 2 through 10 have face value, and a Jack, Queen or King (J,Q,K) are all worth 10 points. The goal of the game is to accumulate as close to 21 points as possible, without going over.

The dealer will deal two cards to each player and two cards to themselves. The player's cards are face up and the dealer's first card is face down. After viewing their initial two cards, players must decide whether to "stand" (take no more cards), "hit" (take another card), "double down" (double their bet and take one more card), "split" (split a hand of two into two separate hands) or "surrender" (give up half their bet and end the hand).

If the player's first two cards are an Ace and a 10-point card (a Jack, Queen or King), they can choose to make a special bet called a "blackjack". This pays out 3:2 on your bet and beats any other hand except for another blackjack. After all players have acted on their hands, the dealer flips over their hole card. If the dealer's total is 16 or less, they must hit; if their total exceeds 16, they must stand. In either case, the dealer must continue taking cards until they reach 17 or more points total; at which point they must stand. Winning bets are paid out at 1:1 odds.

#  Belgians love their flush plus blackjack side bet

The Belgians love their flush plus blackjack side bet, as evidenced by the large number of casinos throughout Belgium that offer the game. In this side bet, players are paid based on their hand, with flush, straight, and three-of-a-kind hands paying out at different rates.

In addition to these standard payouts, players can also win a bonus payout if they are dealt a blackjack as their first two cards. This bonus payout is typically 10x the amount of the player's original bet, making it a lucrative proposition for those who can hit 21 on the first two cards.

While the chances of winning the blackjack bonus are relatively low, the potential payout is high enough that many players are willing to risk it in order to try and win some extra money. And with payouts ranging from 2:1 for a flush to 500:1 for a royal flush, there is plenty of potential payoff for those who can master this side bet.
