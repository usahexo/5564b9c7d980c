#  Justin Bieber Missing House Casino Dream

One moment Justin Bieber was inside his house and the next he was in a casino filled with beautiful women and piles of money. Bieber says the dream started off normal enough, but quickly took a strange turn.

"I was in my house and then I woke up in this casino," Bieber said. "It's like I was dreaming but it felt so real." Bieber said he couldn't believe his eyes when he first saw the casino. "There were all these beautiful women and stacks of cash everywhere," he said. "I thought it was a dream come true."

Bieber says things quickly went downhill from there. "Almost as soon as I arrived, I lost all my money playing poker," he said. "It was humiliating." Bieber says he doesn't know how to explain what happened next, but the next thing he knew he was back in his house. "I have no idea how I got back home," he said. "It's like the whole thing never happened."

Although Bieber insists the dream wasn't enjoyable, some fans say they would love to visit the casino dream world themselves. "I've always wanted to go to Vegas, so this would be perfect," one fan tweeted. Another fan begged Bieber to reveal more about the dream world, writing, "PLEASE TELL ME MORE ABOUT THIS CASINO DREAM WORLD!"

So far, Bieber has not revealed any more details about the mysterious casino dream world. But with his Fans eagerly awaiting more information, it's only a matter of time until we learn more about this bizarre place.

Many of Selena's fans are disappointed in her behavior, and are begging her to get help. Others are choosing to defend her, saying that she's just young and makes mistakes like everyone else.
