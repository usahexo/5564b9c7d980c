#  Final Fantasy XIV: How Often Does Duty Roulette Reset TV Game?

In Final Fantasy XIV, Duty Roulette is a system where players can receive rewards for participating in randomized instances. It is often used as a way to quickly progress through the game's content, as it offers high-quality rewards for lower effort. However, there are some questions about howoften the Duty Roulette resets.

One Reddit user attempted to answer this question by attempting to do every instance in the Duty Roulette and timestamping when it was completed. Unfortunately, this process was flawed, as it did not take into account the possibility of doing an instance more than once. Another user attempted to correct for this issue by taking the average time between completions of each instance. This gave a better picture of howoften each instance reset, but it was still not perfect.

Finally, Square Enix released an official statement on the matter. According to their statement, the Duty Roulette resets every day at 1:00 AM Pacific Standard Time. This means that players who want to complete all of the instances in the Duty Roulette should attempt to do so within a 24-hour period.
