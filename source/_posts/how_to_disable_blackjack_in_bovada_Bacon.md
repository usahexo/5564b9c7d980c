# How to Disable Blackjack in Bovada

Bovada is a popular online gambling platform that offers a variety of games, including blackjack. While blackjack can be a fun and exciting game to play, some users may wish to disable it for personal reasons, such as addiction or to prevent overspending.

Disabling blackjack on Bovada is a simple process, but it should be noted that this action cannot be undone. Once disabled, blackjack will no longer be visible on the Bovada platform, and users will not be able to play the game.

Here are the steps to disable blackjack in Bovada:

1. Log in to your Bovada account.
2. Click on the "Account" button in the top-right corner of the screen.
3. Select "Settings" from the dropdown menu.
4. Scroll down to the "Game Settings" section.
5. Locate the "Blackjack" option and toggle the switch to the left to disable it.
6. Save your changes by clicking on the "Save Changes" button.

Once these steps are completed, blackjack will be disabled on your Bovada account. If you wish to re-enable the game in the future, simply follow the same steps and toggle the switch to the right.

It's important to note that while disabling blackjack on Bovada may help some users limit their gambling, it's important to address any underlying issues related to addiction or overspending. Seeking help from a professional or joining a support group can provide valuable resources for individuals struggling with problem gambling.
