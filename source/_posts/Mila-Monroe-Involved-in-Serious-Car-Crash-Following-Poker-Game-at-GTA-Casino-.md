NHL Star Mila Monroe was injured over the weekend in a gambling-related car accident. Monroe was leaving a casino in Atlantic City when her car struck another vehicle, injuring two people.
The NHL has been quick to distance themselves from Monroe, with league spokesman saying "the league has no affiliation with Ms. Monroe."
Monroe is a rising star in the NHL, and this latest incident could have negative consequences for her career. The 25-year-old has already been suspended by the league once, for an off-the-ice altercation.
It remains to be seen whether Monroe will face any legal repercussions for the accident.

Despite these incidents, Monroe has insisted that she is not afraid to live her life to the fullest. "I'm not going to let some thugs or bad luck keep me from doing what I want," she said in an interview last year. "I'm going to keep on living my life and enjoying myself."
