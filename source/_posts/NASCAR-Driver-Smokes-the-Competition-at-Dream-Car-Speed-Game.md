#  NASCAR Driver Smokes the Competition at Dream Car Speed Game

As a NASCAR driver, you know that you need to be aggressive on the track if you want to win. But what about in a video game?

In Dream Car Speed, a popular racing game for mobile devices, one NASCAR driver has shown that he is the best of the best. In a recent tournament, he smoked the competition, finishing first in all but one race.

What makes this driver's performance even more impressive is that he only started playing the game two months ago. "I'm just amazed at how well I've been doing," he said. "I never thought I could be so good at a video game."

So what is his secret? "I try to stay focused and not get too frustrated if I make a mistake," he said. "And I always make sure to study the tracks beforehand so that I know what to expect."

Clearly, this strategy is working for him. And with another tournament coming up soon, he is determined to keep his winning streak alive.

# Dream Car Speed Game Causing Huge Traffic Jam at Harrah's Casino

A new dream car speed game is causing a huge traffic jam at Harrah's Casino in Las Vegas. The game, which is similar to the popular "Need for Speed" video game series, allows players to drive cars at high speeds around a virtual track.

According to reports, the game has been incredibly popular since it was introduced earlier this month, with long lines of people waiting to play. In fact, the casino has had to bring in additional staff to manage the crowds.

Some people have even been calling it a "mini-CES" due to the amount of people and excitement around the game. The game is currently only available at Harrah's Casino, but there are plans to expand it to other casinos in the near future.

Nevada's Department of Transportation has issued a warning about the traffic jam, urging drivers to avoid the area if possible. "We are urging drivers to avoid the area around Harrah's Casino until the traffic situation improves," said a spokesperson for NDOT.

The traffic jam is expected to continue for the foreseeable future as long as the game continues to be popular.
